# tiktaktoe
This is a tik tak toe game simulator.

It's a 2 player game. One player goes first and selctes a cell. Then the other player selects a cell. Numbers 1-9 will appear on unselected cells. You can select a cell by entering the number of the cell you'd like. The player that claims three cells in a line wins! You may press 1 to play again or 0 to quit. 

You know tik tak toe rules...

I started this project to learn about git hub and there could be a few bugs. Plz let me know about any bugs or any small changes you'd like. I've never had a pull request :(
